            <h2>How Bad Was COVID19 Second Wave?</h2>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="intro">India's surge in infections began around mid-March and increased rapidly, reaching a peak
                of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on Friday, 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell,
                with just under 360,000 on Monday, 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in
                the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that
                shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. And on Thursday, 6 May, the number of new recorded daily
                infections reached a new high of more than 414,000. </p>

            <p class="intro">India has recorded 26 million Covid-19 cases - second only to the US. It is the new
                epicentre of the global pandemic. The second wave in recent weeks has overwhelmed the healthcare system,
                leaving hospitals struggling to cope and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply. Since February 2021,
                countless lives have been lost in India, which has compounded the social and economic devastation caused
                by the second wave of COVID-19. The sharp surge in cases across the country overwhelmed the health
                infrastructure, with people left scrambling for hospital beds, critical drugs, and oxygen. As of May
                2021, infections began to come down in urban areas. However, the effects of the second wave continued to
                be felt in rural areas. This is the worst humanitarian and public health crisis the country has
                witnessed since independence; while the continued spread of COVID-19 variants will have regional and
                global implications. </p>

            <p class="intro">With a slow vaccine rollout and overwhelmed health infrastructure, there is a critical need
                to examine India’s response and recommend measures to further arrest the current spread of infection and
                to prevent and prepare against future waves. This brief is a rapid social science review and analysis of
                the second wave of COVID-19 in India. It draws on emerging reports, literature, and regional social
                science expertise to examine reasons for the second wave, explain its impact, and highlight the systemic
                issues that hindered the response. This brief puts forth vital considerations for local and national
                government, civil society, and humanitarian actors at global and national levels, with implications for
                future waves of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

            <h2>IMA flags 800 doctor deaths in second wave!!</h2>
        <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/lp7940rbtUmfTUPIJa" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/doctor-doctors-cintascotch-lp7940rbtUmfTUPIJa"></a></p>
            <p class="intro">There are some among 800 doctor deaths that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has
                counted in the second wave of Covid-19 this year. A majority were from Bihar and Delhi, as per the IMA,
                which has maintained a state-wise registry of doctors who died of Covid-19. Analysis is underway to
                assess how many were fully vaccinated or had received one jab. Preliminary findings, however, show few
                among them had received full vaccination. A majority also had to receive their first vaccine dose. To
                date, the IMA data shows that more than 1,500 doctors have died of Covid-19. The IMA has declared ‘Save
                the Saviours’ as the theme of this year’s National Doctors’ Day, which is observed on July 1.</p><br>
            <p class="intro">Dr Jayesh Lele, secretary general of IMA headquarters, told that studies were underway and
                information was being collected from each state regarding the number of doctors who had succumbed and
                the number of doctors who had been administered either one or both doses. “So far, we have the data of
                800 doctors in our registry and initial observations indicate that a majority were yet to be fully
                vaccinated. Not many had got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” Dr Lele said, adding that they
                were also looking at data where young doctors had succumbed to Covid-19 and, among primary reasons,
                could be exposure to high viral load in ICUs or CCUs. He, said the analysis was underway. </p><br>
            <p class="intro">According to the state-wise list of doctors who died in the IMA Covid registry, 128 medicos
                were from Delhi, 115 from Bihar and 79 from Uttar Pradesh, who succumbed to the infection. West Bengal
                reported 62 deaths of doctors followed by 51 in Tamil Nadu, 44 in Rajasthan, 42 in Andhra Pradesh, 39
                each in Gujarat and Jharkhand, 37 in Telangana, 36 in Odisha, 24 in Kerala and 23 in Maharashtra.
                Haryana reported 19 deaths while Assam reported 10. Last year, the toll among this high-risk group was
                754. Then, the highest numbers were from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.</p><br><br>

                    April 30, Dr Shanmugapriya went on maternity leave from May 1. “However, she was hospitalised at a
                    private medical college hospital on May 1 after she developed severe cough,” the husband said. She
                    was tested positive for COVID and was later diagnosed with 70% lung infection. The doctor was later
